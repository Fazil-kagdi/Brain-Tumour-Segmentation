Step 1:
Install the necessary libraries

pip install numpy nibabel tensorflow matplotlib scikit-learn torch medpy monai segmentation-models-pytorch tqdm


Step2:
Just sequentially run the cells. Everything should work properly. If you want to skip directly to use the trained model,
run all the cells from the top till the cell marked as "1st stage training". Then skip to the "Data Visualization" cell,
run it to get the outputs.
